# Personal and professional website - Daniel (danielramosbh74)

## [Versão em português brasileiro](https://danielramosbh74.github.io)

## Introduction

I do believe simple things work better. That's why one of my professional goals is help you to simplify your life, both professional and personal too, because they're closely related and one afect the other.

## What I do

Basicaly, I work organizing and summarizing informations.

I do it creating standard procedures in simple and itemized texts documents like this site and also teaching how to use or implement G Suite / Google Apps in your business.

### _This website_ is a _practical example_ of how I do value simple things and how them bring us _benefits_ 
1. Static website (just frontend, Markdown, HTML, CSS e JavaScript)
2. Based on Markdown language and a standard Github theme
3. Free hosted on Github
4. Fast, visually clean and easy to use.

## How do I usually work - My standard proposal - A summary of "Terms of service"

Independant of specific details of your project, I usually work this way:

1. I charge a fixed value "per hour" when we're working TOGETHER, that is, when I access your computer remotely using Chrome Remote Desktop or when I'll be available to consult via Whatsapp while I guide you or receive guidance in some practical task in front of my or your computer.
- These hours of consultancy provided or training received will be controled in a **shared Google Worksheet**, like this [example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RwlMWIJXpUln2lKrowaPILAg6Vsf9COazdYHEu8qr2g/edit?usp=sharing)

2. I charge a CLOSED PRICE "PER TASK" (estimated between 1 and 2 work hours, but focusing in the task, and not in the time spent on it) when I work ALONE.
- For each task a term will be estimated, it will be checked, corrected (if necessary) and approved.
- These tasks will be controled in a **shared Google Worksheet**, like this [example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RwlMWIJXpUln2lKrowaPILAg6Vsf9COazdYHEu8qr2g/edit?usp=sharing)
- To avoid inconvenience, each task will be paid immediatly or unti 2 working days after it's approval.
- Each task will last between 1 and 2 working hours, even when we negociate a closed price for a "package of tasks" (a stage of a "Big project"), minimizing common mistakes that usually occur when estimating working hours ing big projects.

Every big project can be (and must be) divided on "small steps, little stages" (a set of "small tasks", during maximum of 2 working hours each one, and 8 hours for the all package).

Working this way the project will progress softly (without stress), everybody will be satisfied and we'll have a soft financial physical schedule, easy to be paid, with more safety (less risk) for both.

## How much does my work coast

Both working "by the hour" or "by task", the value is variable and fair to negotiate depending on:

1. Benefit of the result of the work for the client
2. Urgency level: quiet or tight deadline
3. Know-how (Almost everything "seems" to be "simple" and "quick" to do, but only for those who have "years of study, dedication and experience")
