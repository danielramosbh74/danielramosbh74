## Introduction

I do believe simple things work better. That's why one of my professional goals is help you to simplify your life, both professional and personal too, because they're closely related and one afect the other.

## How do I work?

Basicaly, I work organizing and summarizing informations.

I do it creating standard procedures in simple and itemized texts documents like this one and also using Google Sheets.

### _This website_ is a _practical example_ of how I do value simple things and how them bring us _benefits_ 
1. Static website (just frontend, HTML, CSS e JavaScript)
2. Based on Markdown language and a standard Github theme
3. Free hosted on Github
4. Fast, visually clean and easy to use.
